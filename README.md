DLMM Data Collector
Overview
The DLMM Data Collector is an advanced script designed to gather, analyze, and provide optimized settings for the SOL Decoder DLMM Bot. It focuses on collecting data from trending pools on the Solana network using the GeckoTerminal API and employs sophisticated mathematical models to generate actionable insights.
Functional Components
1. Data Collection

API Interaction: Utilizes the GeckoTerminal API to fetch data on trending pools in the Solana network.
Data Points: Collects comprehensive information including token prices, market caps, volumes, and price changes across various timeframes (5m, 1h, 6h, 24h).
Error Handling: Implements robust error handling and rate limiting to ensure reliable data collection.

2. Data Processing and Analysis

Data Cleaning: Removes invalid or incomplete data entries to ensure data quality.
Metric Calculation: Computes various metrics including volatility, average volumes, and price changes.
Time Series Analysis: Analyzes historical data to identify trends and patterns.

3. Recommendation Engine

Dynamic Timeframe Selection: Analyzes multiple timeframes to recommend the optimal trading interval.
Risk-Adjusted Recommendations: Generates entry criteria recommendations based on user-selected risk profiles (degen, moderate, conservative).
Adaptive Stop Loss: Calculates stop loss recommendations based on historical volatility and risk tolerance.

4. User Interface

Interactive Console: Provides a rich, interactive console interface for user inputs and data display.
Real-time Updates: Offers real-time data updates and allows users to request recommendations on demand.

Mathematical Models and Calculations
1. Volatility Calculation

Historical Volatility: Calculated using the standard deviation of log returns:
Copyσ = sqrt(Σ(r_i - r̄)² / (n-1))
where r_i = ln(P_i / P_(i-1))

GARCH Model: Implements GARCH(1,1) for volatility forecasting:
Copyσ²_t = ω + α * ε²_(t-1) + β * σ²_(t-1)


2. Score Calculation

Combines Sharpe Ratio and Volume-Adjusted Price Change:
CopyScore = (Sharpe Ratio * 0.4) + (Volume Adjusted Change * 0.6)
Sharpe Ratio = (Average Price Change) / (Price Change Volatility)
Volume Adjusted Change = Average Price Change * sqrt(Average Volume)


3. Market Cap Analysis

Filters and analyzes market caps between $100K and $1B to balance opportunity with stability.

4. Adaptive Stop Loss

Calculates based on maximum historical price changes:
CopyStop Loss % = max(10%, min((max_price_change * 0.4 + 10) * risk_factor, 50%))


5. Optimized Entry Criteria

Utilizes percentile analysis of top-performing tokens to set thresholds for:

Minimum price changes (5m, 1h)
Maximum price change (1h)
Minimum volumes (1h, 24h)
Minimum token age



Advanced Features
1. GARCH Modeling

Implements ARCH library for sophisticated volatility forecasting.
Adapts to market conditions by capturing volatility clustering.

2. Dynamic Timeframe Optimization

Evaluates multiple timeframes (30m to 24h) to determine the most effective trading interval based on current market conditions.

3. Risk Profile Adjustment

Adjusts all recommendations based on user-selected risk profiles, allowing for personalized strategy optimization.

Continuous Operation
The DLMM Data Collector is designed to run continuously, automatically fetching new data every 30 minutes. This ensures that your analysis and recommendations are always based on the most recent market conditions.
Automated Data Collection

The script automatically collects new data every 30 minutes.
This regular update cycle keeps your dataset fresh and relevant.
There's no need to manually restart the script for each data collection cycle.

Keeping the Script Running
To keep the script running continuously:

Launch the script in a terminal or command prompt:
Copypython dlmm_data_collector.py

The script will start its first data collection cycle immediately.
After the initial collection, it will wait 30 minutes before the next cycle.
This process repeats indefinitely until you stop the script.

Interacting with the Running Script
While the script is running and waiting for the next data collection cycle:

You can interact with it at any time by pressing a key.
Available commands:

r: Get recommendations for a specific timeframe and risk mode
t: Get the recommended timeframe and its settings
q: Quit the program



Best Practices for Long-Running Scripts

Terminal Multiplexer: For remote servers or to prevent accidental closure, use a terminal multiplexer like tmux or screen.
Example with tmux:
Copytmux new -s dlmm_collector
python dlmm_data_collector.py
(Detach from the session with Ctrl+B, then D)
Background Process: Run the script as a background process:
Copynohup python dlmm_data_collector.py &

Logging: The script uses logging to track its operations. Monitor the log file for any issues or important information.
System Resources: Ensure your system has enough resources (CPU, memory, disk space) for extended operation.
API Limits: Be aware of any API rate limits that might affect long-term continuous operation.

Stopping the Script
To stop the script:

If running in the foreground: Press Ctrl+C or use the 'q' command when prompted.
If running in the background: Find the process ID and use the kill command.

By running continuously, the DLMM Data Collector provides you with an always-up-to-date analysis of market conditions, allowing for timely and informed decision-making in your trading strategies.
