cd dlmm-data-collector
CopyOr download and extract the ZIP file from the GitHub repository.

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment** (Recommended)
- Create a virtual environment:
  ```
  python -m venv venv
  ```
- Activate the virtual environment:
  - On Windows:
    ```
    venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
  - On macOS and Linux:
    ```
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3. **Install Required Packages**
- Install all required packages using pip:
  ```
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

### Configuration

1. **API Key Setup** (If required)
- If the script requires an API key, create a `.env` file in the project root:
  ```
  API_KEY=your_api_key_here
  ```

### Running the Script

1. **Execute the Script**
python dlmm_data_collector.py
Copy
2. **Navigate the Interface**
- Follow the on-screen prompts to:
  - Select risk profile (Degen, Moderate, Conservative)
  - Choose a timeframe
  - View recommendations
  - Get optimized settings

3. **Available Commands**
- `r`: Get recommendations
- `t`: Get recommended timeframe and ML predictions
- `p`: Manually trigger a data pull
- `q`: Quit program

### Troubleshooting

- If you encounter any package-related errors, ensure all dependencies are correctly installed:
pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade
Copy- For API-related issues, check your internet connection and verify your API key.
- Consult the error messages in the console for specific issues and their potential resolutions.

### Continuous Operation

For long-term operation:
1. Use a terminal multiplexer like `tmux` or `screen`.
2. Run the script in the background:
nohup python dlmm_data_collector.py &
Copy
### Updating

To get the latest version of the script:
1. If you used Git, pull the latest changes:
git pull origin main
Copy2. Reinstall requirements in case of updates:
pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade
Copy
