🧠 DLMM Data Collector
🚀 Overview
The DLMM Data Collector is an advanced script designed to gather, analyze, and optimize settings for the SOL Decoder DLMM Bot. It collects data from trending pools on the Solana network using the GeckoTerminal API and leverages powerful mathematical models to generate actionable insights.


*** known bug do not use the 't' function in the script***

✨ Key Features
📊 Real-Time Data Collection: Gather live data from trending Solana pools.
📈 Advanced Analysis: Perform metrics calculations and time series analysis.
🎯 Recommendations: Provides risk-adjusted entry criteria & adaptive stop loss.
⚙️ Dynamic Optimization: Adjusts timeframe and risk profile automatically.
🔄 Continuous Updates: Auto-refreshes data every 30 minutes.
🧩 Functional Components
📡 Data Collection

API interaction with GeckoTerminal
Collects prices, market caps, volumes, price changes
Robust error handling & rate limiting
🔍 Data Processing & Analysis

Data cleaning for quality assurance
Calculate key metrics (volatility, volume, price changes)
Identifies historical trends and patterns
💡 Recommendation Engine

Dynamically selects timeframe
Provides risk-adjusted recommendations (Degen, Moderate, Conservative)
Calculates adaptive stop losses
🖥️ User Interface

Interactive console with real-time data updates
On-demand recommendations
📐 Mathematical Models
Volatility Calculation

Historical Volatility: 𝜎 = sqrt(Σ(r_i - r̄)² / (n-1))
GARCH Model: σ²_t = ω + α * ε²_(t-1) + β * σ²_(t-1)
Score Calculation

CopyScore = (Sharpe Ratio * 0.4) + (Volume Adjusted Change * 0.6)
Sharpe Ratio = (Average Price Change) / (Price Change Volatility)
Volume Adjusted Change = Average Price Change * sqrt(Average Volume)
Adaptive Stop Loss

Stop Loss % = max(10%, min((max_price_change * 0.4 + 10) * risk_factor, 50%))
⚙️ Advanced Features
GARCH Modeling: Forecasts volatility with advanced techniques 📊
