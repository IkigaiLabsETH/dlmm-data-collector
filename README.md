DLMM Data Collector
Overview
The DLMM Data Collector is an advanced script for gathering, analyzing, and optimizing settings for the SOL Decoder DLMM Bot. It collects data from trending pools on the Solana network using the GeckoTerminal API and employs sophisticated mathematical models to generate actionable insights.
Key Features

Data Collection: Real-time data from Solana network trending pools
Analysis: Advanced metrics calculation and time series analysis
Recommendations: Risk-adjusted entry criteria and adaptive stop loss
Dynamic Optimization: Automatic timeframe selection and risk profile adjustment
Continuous Operation: Automated data updates every 30 minutes

Functional Components
1. Data Collection

API interaction with GeckoTerminal
Comprehensive data points (prices, market caps, volumes, price changes)
Robust error handling and rate limiting

2. Data Processing and Analysis

Data cleaning for quality assurance
Metric calculation (volatility, volumes, price changes)
Historical trend and pattern identification

3. Recommendation Engine

Dynamic timeframe selection
Risk-adjusted recommendations (degen, moderate, conservative profiles)
Adaptive stop loss calculations

4. User Interface

Rich, interactive console interface
Real-time data updates and on-demand recommendations

Mathematical Models
Volatility Calculation

Historical Volatility: σ = sqrt(Σ(r_i - r̄)² / (n-1))
GARCH Model: σ²_t = ω + α * ε²_(t-1) + β * σ²_(t-1)

Score Calculation
CopyScore = (Sharpe Ratio * 0.4) + (Volume Adjusted Change * 0.6)
Sharpe Ratio = (Average Price Change) / (Price Change Volatility)
Volume Adjusted Change = Average Price Change * sqrt(Average Volume)
Adaptive Stop Loss
CopyStop Loss % = max(10%, min((max_price_change * 0.4 + 10) * risk_factor, 50%))
Advanced Features

GARCH Modeling: Sophisticated volatility forecasting
Dynamic Timeframe Optimization: Evaluates timeframes from 30m to 24h
Risk Profile Adjustment: Personalized strategy optimization
